# step 1: display the rules of the game
# step 2: ask how many humans are playing 
# step 3: display each gesture option 

# build game class steps 1-3 and have methods for rules, asking how many humans, and displaying gesture. then run_game method which calls all the other ones 

# step 4: ask the humans which gesture they want to pick
# step 5: display what each player and/or AI chose for their gesture 
# step 6: display who won the round or if it was a tie
# step 7: repeat steps 3 - 6 until someone has 2 wins
# step 8: display the winner of the game

# player base class and an AI class
# if theres 2 players, they each inherit from player base class which stores the logic for asking what gesture they want to pick
# if theres a player and an AI the player inherits from player base class and and the ai is from separate class that randomizes gesture choice.
